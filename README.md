# Real Analysis

A collection of notes on Real Analysis that I may or may not develop over time. The associated difficulties of reading through books whilst maintaining time for other interests and work is numerous, but I enjoy my mathematical advancements.

## Rudin's _Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd Edition_

An extremely difficult book recommended to me by numerous professors who sought to challenge my mathematical skills and understanding. It is one of the most difficult books I've had the pleasure of reading, and I hope to elucidate on Rudin's theorems for future understanding.
